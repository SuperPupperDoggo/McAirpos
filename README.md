It should also work with other controllers with little or no modification of the uinput-mapper [_arcadeX.py_ config files](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos#default-and-modifying-the-layout-for-controls). 

Feedback is valueable, so please don't hesitate to [open an issue here](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/issues) for sharing with the community about other controllers that work, or if [something doesn't work for you](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos#issues).

## Make your own or dowload MakeCode Arcade games for RetroPie
I've made a solution for making [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com?nolocalhub=1&hw=rpi&compile=rawELF) ready for downloading native executables of games here:<br>
https://vegz78.github.io/McAirpos

Either make your own games in the MakeCode web editor, or download from various places, like:

- [MakeCode Arcade home (https://arcade.makecode.com)](https://arcade.makecode.com?nolocalhub=1&hw=rpi&compile=rawELF)
- [MakCode's official forum](https://forum.makecode.com/c/Share-your-Arcade-projects-here/show-tell/)
- [itch.io](https://itch.io) (search for MakeCode Arcade game jams)
- [Here on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=makecode+arcade+game&type=Repositories)
- Other suggestions where to find good games?

[![](docs/MakeCode_Arcade_Raspberry_Pi.png)](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/blob/master/docs/MakeCode_Arcade_Raspberry_Pi.png?raw=true)
## Contents
- [Tool for setting the MakeCode Arcade editor in native executable mode for downloading executables](https://vegz78.github.io/McAirpos)
- A game launcher, [_launCharc_](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/tree/master/McAirpos/launCharc), for:
  - keeping the game in the foreground in RetroPie, 
  - cleaning up the terminal on exit, 
  - automatically detecting and setting up gamepad and keyboard controls
- [uinput-mapper](https://github.com/MerlijnWajer/uinput-mapper) to map gamepad inputs to the keyboard 

## Features
- Launch and exit natively executable MakeCode Arcade games gracefully from RetroPie and the Raspberry Pi OS console
- Autodetect gamepad and keyboard controls for up to 2 players
- [Easily download and ready the editor for natively executable game files](https://vegz78.github.io/McAirpos)

## Why the need for McAirpos?
The current MakeCode Arcade natively executable game files compiled with the Raspberry Pi as target have 2 problems preventing a nice experience from within RetroPie:
- The parent game process ID shifts during game play, which makes RetroPie think the game has exited and then puts it still running in the background. On exit, the game files do not release and clean up the framebuffer and key inputs, giving the impression that the system has frozen/halted.<br>
https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/issues/2435
- The game files natively do not support most newer [EV_ABS type](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/event-codes.txt) or multiple game controllers, but only 1 [EV_KEY type](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/event-codes.txt) gamepad or 1 keyboard input event, even though multiple players are supported in the games.<br>
https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/issues/2245

McAirpos works around both these issues, making MakeCode Arcade games play like other games in RetroPie.

## Prerequisites
- Git (```sudo apt install git```)
- Drivers for gamepads you have that don't work "out of the box"
- [ALSA sound driver](https://forum.makecode.com/t/how-to-launch-makecode-arcade-uf2s-in-raspbian-retropie/2725/2)

## Installation
### Quick automatic installation for RetroPie/RPi OS
Run this command without sudo in a terminal or the CLI on RetroPie/RPi OS:<br>
```curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/master/install.sh | bash -```

Or clone the repository like in the 1st manual installation point below and run:<br>
```~/McAirpos/install.sh```

### Manual installation for RetroPie/RPi OS
1. Clone this repo from and into _/home/pi/_:<br>
```git clone https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos.git```<br>
_(Paths are currently hardcoded and will only work with the repo directly under /home/pi/)_
2. Copy the folder _.../MakeCode/sd_ with all its contents into the root folder _/_:<br>
```sudo cp -r ~/McAirpos/McAirpos/MakeCode/sd /```<br>
_(The game files are hardcoded to write to and read from this root/sd folder)_
3. Make sure the contents of _/sd_ are owned and writable for your user(normally _pi_):<br>
From _/_: ```sudo chown -R pi /sd&&sudo chgrp -R pi /sd&&sudo chmod -R 755 /sd```
4. Copy the _contents_ of the file _./McAirpos/EmulationStation/es_systems.cfg_MakeCode_ into the end of the file _/etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg_. Make sure not to delete the _\</systemList\>_ tag at the end of the file.
5. Copy the folder _./McAirpos/EmulationStation/makecode_ with all its contens into _/etc/emulationstation/themes/carbon/_.<br>
```sudo cp -r ~/McAirpos/McAirpos/EmulationStation/makecode /etc/emulationstation/themes/carbon```
6. Create a _makecode_ games folder under _/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/_ and [fill it up with native MakeCode Arcade games](https://vegz78.github.io/McAirpos).<br>
Make sure that the _makecode_ games folder is owned by _pi_ and has the correct permissions. From inside this folder:<br>
```sudo chown -R pi .&&sudo chgrp -R pi .&&sudo chmod -R 755 .```<br>
Also, make sure that every _game\_file.elf_ has executable permissions if they aren't set automatically when copying them to the _makecode_ games folder:<br>
```sudo chmod +x ~/RetroPie/roms/makecode/*.elf```

### Quick automatic installation for Recalbox
Run this command from the terminal(F4 + ALT+F2, root/recalboxroot) on Recalbox 7.1.1-Reloaded!:<br>
```curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/master/install_recalbox.sh | bash -```

## Updating
Bugfixes, changes and additions are released sporadically as updates to the main branch, without any formal system for releases and history. News about the latest and most important updates are published with dates in the [development section](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos#development-news), with links to further details in the commit comments. 

Updates to included files located outside the _~/home/pi/McAirpos_ are seldomly expected, so to update, from inside this folder, simply type: ```git pull```

Alternatively, if you've made changes to any of the files in this folder, simply back up those files, and then remove the folder an clone again, from _/home/pi_: ```rm -rf ./McAirpos&&git clone https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos.git```

## Usage
- Fire up EmulationStation and navigate to your MakeCode Arcade games menu and select the game to play, or
- Run from the text console(games do not run within X):<br>
```~/McAirpos/McAirpos/launCharc/launCharc ~/RetroPie/roms/makecode/_gamefile.elf_```

  - ```nomap``` command line option for manual configuration of 1 keyboard(2 players) or 1 [EV_KEY type](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/event-codes.txt) gamepad(1 player) using the _/sd/arcade.cfg_ file directly without running uinput-mapper:<br>
```~/McAirpos/McAirpos/launCharc/launCharc nomap ~/RetroPie/roms/makecode/_gamefile.elf_```<br> and similarly inside _/etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg_.
  - ```keybswap``` command line option for swapping from the lowest(default) autodiscovered keyboard input handler to the highest, if your keyboard is not detected correctly.
  - ```verbose``` command line option for verbose logging to stdout instead of _/tmp/McAirpos.log_.

**NB: The _game\_files.elf_ and launCharc only work in RetroPie(booted directly into or started from the CLI) and in the [Linux console/CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_console). They do not work(cannot open gfx display) when run in a terminal emulator or in RetroPie started from within a desktop/gui/X environment.**

If something goes wrong and the screen/keyboard freezes inside the game, it should be possible to regain control of the console/RetroPie by a combination of _CTRL+\\, CTRL+C, CTRL+D and CTRL+C_.

## Default and modifying the layout for controls
|Move|Keyb pl1|Keyb pl2|Gamepads pl1&pl2|
|----|--------|--------|--------|
|Up  |W       |Up arrow|DPAD/Hat/Axis UP|
|Down|S       |Down arrow|DPAD/Hat/Axis DOWN|
|Left|A       |Left arrow|DPAD/Hat/Axis LEFT|
|Right|D      |Right arrow|DPAD/Hat/Axis RIGHT|
|Fire|Left Ctrl|Right ALT|BTN_SOUTH/BTN_A|
|Fire2|Left Shift|Space bar|BTN_EAST/BTN_B|
|Exit|Esc||BTN_START|
|Restart|F1||BTN_SELECT|
|Menu|F2||BTN_MODE/BTN_PS|

To change button layouts, edit _/sd/arcade.cfg_ for keyboard(or 1 [EV_KEY type](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/event-codes.txt) gamepad) and edit the uinput mapping files _arcade1.py_ and _arcade2.py_ under _~/McAirpos/McAirpos/uinput-mapper/configs/_ for 1-2 [EV_ABS type](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/event-codes.txt) gamepads. When using EV_ABS type gamepads with uinput-mapper, always remember to edit the corresponding gamepad-to-keyboard mappings in both the _arcade1&2.py_ files for any changes you might have made to _/sd/arcade.cfg_, as the former is closely dependent on the latter.

For many gamepads, there should be no or little need for modification of the config files. For [DIY Arcade controllers](https://www.google.com/search?q=diy+arcade+controllers&source=lmns&tbm=shop&bih=792&biw=1508), you might save some time and complexity by __*please checking that the physical wirings are correct*__ before attempting to modify the config files:
1. <a id="evtest-readout"></a>Find your gamepad's _input eventX number_: ```more /proc/bus/input/devices```
2. Read out all the gamepad's registered button names and types, and test to which button name each physical button is mapped by running: ```evtest /dev/input/eventX```, where X is the input number found in the first point. Exit _evtest_ with CTRL+C.

In an attempt to maximize the number of game controllers supported, McAirpos runs a self-calibrating routine on every launch of a game and has a few redundant uinput mappings. Even though it has been reported to run allright even on a Raspberry Pi Zero, if you experience an occasional hang in either direction(before max stroke in all directions is read) or you are technically inclined to optimize, you can [hardcode the _min_ and _max_ values](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/blob/e47f0ba63c466bc92f7bb016eeb09f0db19e7eb0/McAirpos/uinput-mapper/configs/arcade1.py#L16) according the readout above for your gamepad and [remove the mappings that are redundant](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/blob/e47f0ba63c466bc92f7bb016eeb09f0db19e7eb0/McAirpos/uinput-mapper/configs/arcade1.py#L126) in _arcade1&2.py_. Personally, I don't bother, and just do a quick 360 degrees stick movement every time I start a new game...

## Issues
Don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/issues) if it doesn't work as expected or you have suggestions for improvements. But please first:
1. Check the physical wiring of DIY Arcade controllers and whether [your issue might already have been solved](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), and
2. Provide an [_evtest_ readout of your controller](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos#evtest-readout) with indications about which button functions you intend for which listed input events<br>

I'm still just learning to code and I don't mind a little [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code) as long as it just works.. ;-)<br>

I would really appreciate feedbacks from your own experiences with McAirpos and maybe pick up some tricks of the trade while we sort out the bugs together!

[**2021.01.26:**](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos#installation) Got tired of doing the manual installation procedure on all my test images and made a quick automatic installation script for everyone to use.<br>
[**2021.01.24:**](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/commit/c1350073bc3ba21be16c098a44f46469a3658fd4) Stability improvements for game launch and exit, more accurate keyboard autodiscovery, defaults to lowest keyboard input event handler, new ```keybswap``` command line option to swap to highest.<br>
[**2021.01.18:**](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/commit/932740f491cf1afede31578a6077f6ab5c2994f8) Bugfixes, improvements and further testing, most notably fixed the occasional mismatch of /dev/input/eventX between uinput-mapper and launCharc in /sd/arcade.cfg, and now possible to map 1 & 2 controllers without keyboard connected. Feedback about additional working controllers and about possible reasons for occasional instability/game exit, especially on older RPi devices and RPi OS/RetroPie distros, is still appreciated.<br>
[**2021.01.15:**](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/commit/fd8ac34ed5891ed8fa860b41d586f8fdc976a1aa) Added ```nomap``` option for manual configuration and use of _/sd/arcade.cfg_ directly for controllers, instead of auto-detection and uinput-mapper. With some great help from [@Kay-Wolfe](https://github.com/Kay-Wolfe), gamepad support is now expanded.

## Todo
Some thoughts and ideas I might start grappling with in the near or distant future. Don't hesitate to post good ideas in the issues section. If it's to big or difficult for me, maybe you want to contribute directly with a pull request?
- Follow up bugs and improve stability
- Expand gamepad support further
- Collect a library of well working controller configurations(Please share working _/sd/arcade.cfg_ and _arcade1&2.py_ files with the name and type of controllers in [the issues section](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/issues))
- ~~Silent start, verbose option and/or log file~~
- ~~Support and install script for RecalBox~~
- Attempt to include as scriptmodule in RetroPie-Setup and as an included system in Recalbox?(Going to be needing some help with this, anyone up to the task?)
- More command line options;
  - Specify wanted /dev/input/eventXs manually,
  - Incorporate/allow to connect via [other mapping apps/scripts](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/issues/5#issuecomment-760950633)
  - Try to [use some of the controller configurations already set up in RetroPie](https://github.com/Vegz78/McAirpos/issues/5#issuecomment-761888132)<br>
- Make more generic as a launcher for other games needing controller mapping?
